Machine learning and Data Science is a world in itself!!
Here's another Project which depicts the Successability of the different projects that were started in 2016 according to our dataset.
The main aim of this project is to tell that the cetain project will be successful or it will fail by applying machine learning algorith.
In this I have used LOGISTIC REGRESSION to determine the success, splitting my data into training and testing models and predicting the successful one.
I have plotted the relation for your convenience and used the matrix to show the result.

I am including JUPYTER NOTEBBOK file so that you can see the outcome.
I am also including the python file just in case.

Feel free to have a look at NOTEBOOK as it will clarify the project visually and conceptually.
